### Single-Responsibility

So the Gang of Four laid the first foundation of OOP design patterns more than 2 decades ago, it’s outdated in my opinion. But it could still be useful when adhering to clean code. This very first principle states that a class should do only one job! Yes this is the meaning of single responsibility and there is no need to sugar coat it. “A class = performs one operation” simple and stupid.
